Website housing a few tutorials on basic concepts in machine learning.

- **Regression Methods**: Polynomial regression, logistic regression, and softmax regression. 

- **Support Vector Machines**: Hard-margin and soft-margin linear SVMs, the lagrangian dual of the soft-margin optimization problem, and the kernel trick for nonlinear SVMs. 

- **Image Compression**: Unsupervised learning (k-means clustering), the singular value decomposition, and spectral analysis as methods of image compression.
